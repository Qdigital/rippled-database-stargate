### Ledger Removal
The `rmledger.py` tool removes all data corresponding wth a ledger index
number provided on the command line with the `-l` option.

To use, deploy on PostgreSQL servers and edit the script so that the
`dsn` variable reflects the proper connection attributes for the database.

The tool has no output unless a database error occurs.
